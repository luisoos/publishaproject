# How to simply host a website + custom domain

Hello developers. You probably just made an website or finished an project. Letâ€˜s publish it without wasting money. 

In this quick guide I will show you how to publish an repository / project with GitHub pages and how to get a free custom domain to it. 

## Host with GitHub pages
Create or go to one of your repositoryâ€™s on GitHub. 
If you havenâ€˜t already: create an `index.html` file. 
Go to the settings and scroll down to GitHub Pages. 
Under `Source`: click on the dropdown menu `None` and select main.
Hit the `Save` button behind. 

Your done. Your project will be available at `<YourUsername>.github.io/<ProjectName>`. For example: this project would be available at `luisoos.github.io/publishaproject`. 

## Custom Domain
This github.io domain is too long? I got you! 

We are going to get an free domain and redirect to your GitHub Pages project. 

#### Get domain

If you donâ€™t already have an domain visit https://www.freenom.com/. 
Register yourself (I recommend fake data!) and head to the homepage. 
Just type into the search-bar your project name or whatever you want - this is going to be your first domain-part. 
Multiple free domain-endings will appear. 
Choose one and click on `Get it now!` 
Set the time period to 12 months and hit continue. 
Accept the **Terms and Conditions** and click on `Complete Order`.


#### URL-Forwarding
After that go to `Services` and hit `My Domains`. 
Click on `Manage Domain` and hit `Management Tools` and go to `URL Forwarding`. 
There: just type in your GitHub Pages Link and click on `Set URL`. 

## Pro Trip
While setting up GitHub Pages you can set up an custom domian aswell!

### And thatâ€™s all! You are done!
